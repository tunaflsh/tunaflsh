### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student (starting Master degree soon) interested in AI. I've been thinking about a universal solution to all problems since my childhood, and always thought the solution lies in maths. It turns out I should've been focusing on natural language.

I don't know how or if you would reach out to me. But anyway, I speak English, German, Russian and Vietnamese.

Here is my gist on AI papers I find important and relevant: [My Personal Collection of AI Papers](https://gist.github.com/tunaflsh/b391441be5254218ab665c64cef53272)
